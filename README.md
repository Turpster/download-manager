# Download Manager
I begin by thinking of what language I should write a Download Manager for. The first language that springs to mind is Java that brings a cross-platform GUI named swing. But I digress to favour other languages. It's not that I have a problem with Java, I just believe that I want more of a challenge.

I lay down my idea to make a Python application using the Tkinter library to support all platforms, this will be a hard challenge since I have never properly dealt with sockets in Python.
